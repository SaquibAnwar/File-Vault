## 🔧 Development Features

- Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
- React Query DevTools for debugging data fetching
- TypeScript for better development experience
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

1. **Port Conflicts**
   ```bash
   # If ports 3000 or 8000 are in use, modify docker-compose.yml or use:
   # Frontend: npm start -- --port 3001
   # Backend: python manage.py runserver 8001
   ```

2. **File Upload Issues**
   - Maximum file size: 10MB
   - Ensure proper permissions on media directory
   - Check network tab for detailed error messages

3. **Database Issues**
   ```bash
   # Reset database
   rm backend/data/db.sqlite3
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
